        <p>Welcome to this simple web application.</p>
        <h2>Pipeline Description</h2>
        <p>This application is part of a DevOps pipeline designed to automate the processes of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) for a microservices-based web application. The pipeline is configured as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Source Control:</strong> The application code is stored in a GitHub repository.</li>
            <li><strong>Continuous Integration:</strong> Jenkins is used to automate the CI process, which includes cloning the repository and building a Docker image.</li>
            <li><strong>Automated Testing:</strong> Automated tests are integrated into the pipeline to ensure code quality and functionality.</li>
            <li><strong>Continuous Delivery:</strong> The Docker image is pushed to Docker Hub, and the application is deployed to a local Kubernetes cluster managed by Minikube.</li>
            <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> Kubernetes (minikube) deployment and service configurations are used to manage the application instances and expose them to the network.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With this pipeline, we achieve a streamlined and automated workflow that ensures consistent application delivery and deployment.</p>
